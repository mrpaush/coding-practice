//Very Hard:
// Dynamic Programming
//Problem 1:  Write a program to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence of size 3.
//Problem 2: Write a program that finds the maximum sum of a submatrix in a 2D array.
//Problem 3: Write a program to solve a complex dynamic programming problem with intricate state definition (e.g.,  Edit Distance, Optimal Matrix Chain Multiplication)
// Graph Algorithms
//Problem 4: Write a program that finds the shortest path in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.
//Problem 5: Implement a graph algorithm to solve a more complex optimization problem (e.g.,  Traveling Salesman Problem approximation, Network Flow).
// Complex String / Pattern Matching
//Problem 6:  Implement a regular expression matching engine with support for advanced pattern features.
//Problem 7:  Write a program for text segmentation or tokenization with complex rules.
// Optimization
//Problem 8:  Write a program to find the Kth largest (or smallest) element in an unsorted array efficiently (e.g., using Median of Medians algorithm) .
//Problem 9:  Implement an efficient algorithm to find the longest palindromic substring. (Consider Manacher's algorithm)
// Advanced Data Structures (Conceptual)
//Problem 10: Design a data structure tailored to a specific problem where common structures are inefficient. Explain the reasoning and operations.
