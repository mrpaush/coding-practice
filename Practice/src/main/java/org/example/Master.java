//Master:
// Dynamic Programming Mastery
//Problem 1:  Find the maximum sum of a subarray with adjacency constraints (2, 3, or more), introducing flexibility in constraints.
//Problem 2: Find the maximum sum of a subarray with advanced constraints (e.g., length range, number of distinct elements, etc.)
// Graph Algorithms
//Problem 3: Implement cycle detection in a graph (DFS or Union-Find based).
// Problem 4: Implement an advanced graph algorithm and apply it to solve a complex optimization problem  (e.g., strongly connected components, min-cut/max-flow).
// Complex String Manipulation
//Problem 5: Write a program to find the longest substring with all distinct characters.
//Problem 6: Implement advanced text transformation based on complex patterns, regular expressions, or parsing rules.
// Algorithm Design and Real-World Focus
//Problem 7: Design an efficient algorithm for a problem that doesn't fit standard techniques. Provide a clear explanation and justification of your design.
//Problem 8: Solve a complex problem from a past ACM ICPC contest (provide a link or description).
//Problem 9: Solve a complex problem from a past Google Code Jam contest (provide a link or description).
//Problem 10: Count the Number of Islands in a Grid with Unique Shapes (as previously discussed).
