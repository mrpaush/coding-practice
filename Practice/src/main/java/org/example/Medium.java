//Medium:
// String Manipulation
//Problem 1: Write a program that reverses a string without using any built-in reverse methods.
//Problem 2: Write a program that checks if a string is a palindrome.
//Problem 3: Write a program that finds the longest substring without repeating characters.
//Problem 4: Write a program to implement a basic text editor function (e.g., find and replace, text insertion/deletion).
// Array Manipulation
//Problem 5: Write a program to implement a more advanced sorting algorithm (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or Heap Sort).
//Problem 6: Write a program to search for an element in a sorted array (Binary Search).
// Data Structures
//Problem 7: Write a program that implements a basic stack with push, pop, and peek methods.
//Problem 8: Write a program that implements a basic queue with enqueue, dequeue, and peek methods.
//Problem 9: (If trees are introduced):  Write a program for basic tree traversal (e.g., pre-order, in-order, post-order) on a simple binary tree.
// Recursion
//Problem 10: Write a program that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
//Problem 11:  Write a recursive function to solve a problem like the Tower of Hanoi.
