//Expert:
// Dynamic Programming Mastery
//Problem 1:  Solve a dynamic programming problem with a large state space or complex constraints. Optimize for both time and space complexity.
//Problem 2:  Design a dynamic programming solution for a problem where the optimal substructure is not immediately obvious.
// Graph Algorithms and Applications
//Problem 3: Implement a graph algorithm to solve a real-world optimization scenario (e.g., logistics routing, resource scheduling).
//Problem 4: Modify or adapt a known graph algorithm to fit a problem with unusual  constraints or requirements.
// Algorithm Design and Adaptation
//Problem 5: Design an efficient algorithm for a problem that doesn't seem to fit standard techniques. Justify your design choices.
//Problem 6:  Analyze the time and space complexity of several possible approaches to a problem. Choose the best one given performance requirements and potential input characteristics.
// Optimization
//Problem 7: Optimize the performance of a computationally expensive solution (may involve algorithm tweaks, data structure choices, or even some awareness of system-level caching)
// Ambiguity and Open-endedness
//Problem 8:  Design a solution for a problem where the input format or success criteria are loosely defined, requiring clarification and assumptions.
//Problem 9:  Evaluate different algorithms or approaches for a problem where  the "best" solution depends on tradeoffs and real-world usage patterns.
//Problem 10: Implement a simple machine learning model or a statistical analysis method to solve a problem (focus on algorithm and reasoning).
