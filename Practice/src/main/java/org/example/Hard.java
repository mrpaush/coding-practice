//Hard:
// Dynamic Programming
//Problem 1:  Write a program that finds the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
//Problem 2: Write a program that finds the maximum sum of a subarray with at least k elements.
//Problem 3: Write a program that finds the number of ways to decode a message, given 'A' = '1', 'B'='2', etc.
//Problem 4: Write a program to solve a classic dynamic programming problem (e.g., Coin Change, Knapsack Problem).
// Graph Algorithms
//Problem 5: Write a program that finds the shortest path in a grid from a start to an end, considering blocked cells. Introduce a heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance) for efficiency.
//Problem 6: Write a program that finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph (Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm).
// Trees
//Problem 7: Write a program that checks if a binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST).
//Problem 8: Write a program to find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a BST (or a general tree).
//Problem 9: Write a program to implement BST insertion and deletion.
// Advanced Concepts
//Problem 10: Write a program that finds the longest common subsequence of two (or three) strings.
//Problem 11: (Optional - Backtracking): Write a program to solve a problem that requires backtracking (e.g., Sudoku Solver, N-Queens problem).
