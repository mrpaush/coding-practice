# Project Problems

## Easy:

### Output and Calculations
- Problem 1: Write a program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.
- Problem 2: Write a program that prints your name and age via scanner. It should be in the format "name, age".
- Problem 3: Write a program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius. Formula is A = Ï€r^2.
- Problem 4: Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit (or vice versa). formula is C = (F-32)*5/9 or F = (C*9/5)+32

### Conditionals
- Problem 5: FizzBuzz Sum: Calculate the sum of 1 to 100, without counting numbers that are multiples of 3 AND 5, ex: 15
- Problem 6: Write a program to determine if a given number is even or odd.
- Problem 7:  Write a program to find the largest of three numbers.

### Loops
- Problem 8: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 100.
- Problem 9:  Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number. (No recursion)
- Problem 10: Write a program to generate the first 15 numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence. (No recursion)

### Arrays and Input
- Problem 11: List Addition:  Write a program that takes two lists of numbers and creates a new list containing the sum of corresponding elements from the input lists.
- Problem 12: Element Removal  Write a program that takes a list of numbers and a target value, and removes all occurrences of the target value from the list.
- Problem 13: Write a program to find the maximum value in an array.
- Problem 14: Write a program to calculate the average of the numbers in an array.

## Medium:

### String Manipulation
- Problem 1: Write a program that reverses a string without using any built-in reverse methods.
- Problem 2: Write a program that checks if a string is a palindrome. (No recursion)
- Problem 3: Write a program that finds the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Array Manipulation
- Problem 4: Write a program to implement Merge sort.
- Problem 5: Write a program to search for a number in a sorted array (Binary Search).

### Data Structures
- Problem 6: Write a program that implements a basic stack with push, pop, and peek methods.
- Problem 7: Write a program that implements a basic queue with enqueue, dequeue, and peek methods.
- Problem 8: Write a program for basic tree traversal (e.g., pre-order, in-order, post-order) on a simple binary tree.

### Recursion
- Problem 9: Write a program that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
- Problem 10: Write a recursive function that sums the digits of a number. ex: 123 -> 1+2+3 = 6
- Problem 11: Write a recursive function to determine if a string is a palindrome.
